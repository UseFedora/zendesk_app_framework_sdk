## Zendesk App Framework (ZAF) SDK

ZAF SDK is a JavaScript library that simplifies cross-frame communication between an external website and the Zendesk app containing it. See [Getting Started: IFrames in Apps](../iframes_in_apps.html) for an introduction on embedding external websites in apps.

When you include the ZAF SDK on your website you get access to the `ZAFClient` object.
